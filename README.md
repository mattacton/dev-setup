# dev-setup
Various configs and things to make setup faster


## Setup
Never tested, but hopefully it'll work to run `one-time-bash.sh`

Then you can run `apt-get-install` to install other things. 

### Pre-reqs
* WSL - if on Windows 10
* Git installed

### Script Order
* `one-time/wsl.sh`
* `apt-get-install.sh`
* `one-time/one-time-bash.sh`
* `one-time/go-setup.sh`
